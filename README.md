<h1>Comp2068 Assignment 2</h1>

This is an assignment for COMP2068 where I created a web application with CRUD functionality.

The application allows authenticated users to add, modify and delete books and reviews of said books.

Users are able to upload images of book covers when adding a book. (This is my student feature).

All CRUD functions are hidden to public users and only authenticated users can see them.

Application also allows users to sign in with github.
